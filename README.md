# RealTimeDataPlotter
Welcome to the RealTimeDataPlotter project! This repository contains a Python interface for real-time plotting of data measured by a microcontroller. The project uses the serial port to transmit data from the microcontroller to your computer, where it is visualized dynamically using Python.

# Features:

Real-Time Data Visualization: Plot values in real-time as they are transmitted from the microcontroller.
Serial Communication: Seamlessly read data from the serial port.
Customizable Plots: Easily adjust plot settings for different data types and visual preferences.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use Python interface.
Getting Started:

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed.
Connect Microcontroller: Set up your microcontroller to send data via the serial port.
Run the Script: Execute the provided Python script to start visualizing data in real-time.

# Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Matplotlib
PySerial
