# RealTimeDataPlotter
Welcome to the RealTimeDataPlotter project! This repository contains a Python interface for real-time plotting of data measured by a microcontroller. The project uses the serial port to transmit data from the microcontroller to your computer, where it is visualized dynamically using Python.
